This repository contains the backend for the UGC Net project.

Work for Issue #2: scaffold a FastAPI-based project structure with API versioning, SQLAlchemy, Postgres and Docker support.

Quickstart (development):

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and adjust settings if needed.
2. Start services with Docker Compose:

	docker-compose up --build

3. The API will be available at http://localhost:8000/api/v1/health
